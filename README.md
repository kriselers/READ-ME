# READ ME

Hello everyone,

My name is Kris, I'm a software dev most proficiant in Java and Python, but I'm trying to learn all the languages I can. I have other repositories that are set to private because they are relevant to past course work at Texas A&M. This is to prevent students that are currently taking some of my past courses from copying the projects. If these projects would like to be viewed for recruitment purposes, please let me know and I'll allow access to them.
